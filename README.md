# Think Python Exercises

## Overview
In order to improve my abilities with Python, and programming in general, I have been reading through [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/), 2nd Edition. This book has been great for both introducing me to Python syntax and refreshing me on some fundamental computer science concepts and terminology. The programming exercises are pretty fun and my solutions can be found in the subsequent chapter directories of this repository.

## File Naming
When I started this I wasn't sure how to name the files & sparse modules created for the examples. I began by naming the files with a convention ex[ercise].x.y.z.py where x, y, and z represent chapter, section and exercise numbers respectively. However, I later ran into some trouble trying to import these functions later when I wanted to use them (for example, exercise 11.10.1) due to the multiple periods. As the entire purpose of working through these examples is to learn I updated my convention part way through to use underscores (ex[ample]_x_y_z.py). However, when reviewing some of the previous examples I noticed myself waffling between either. You'll have to forgive me for this bad form which I am well aware of. One day perhaps I'll fix this.
