# Think Python Exercises

In order to improve my abilities with Python, and programming in general, I have been reading through [Think Python](https://greenteapress.com/wp/think-python-2e/), 2nd Edition. This book has been great for both introducing me to Python syntax and refreshing me on some fundamental computer science concepts and terminology. The programming exercises are pretty fun and my solutions can be found in the subsequent chapter directories of this repository.
