""" Think Python, 2nd Ed
Chapter 14, Exercise 2  

If you download my solution to Exercise 2 from
http://thinkpython2.com/code/anagram_sets.py, you’ll see that it
creates a dictionary that maps from a sorted string of letters to the
list of words that can be spelled with those letters. For example,
'opst' maps to the list ['opts', 'post', 'pots', 'spot', 'stop',
'tops'].

Write a module that imports anagram_sets and provides two new
functions: store_anagrams should store the anagram dictionary in a
“shelf”; read_anagrams should look up a word and return a list of its
anagrams. Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/anagram_db.py.  """
