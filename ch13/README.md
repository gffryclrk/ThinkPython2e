## Exercise 6 (skipped)
I skipped exercise 6 because the instruction was to implement the dicitionary differences by using set difference which was the approach I had already taken. 

> Exercise 6
> 
> Python provides a data structure called set that provides many common set operations. You can read about them in Section 19.5, or read the documentation at http://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#types-set.
> 
> Write a program that uses set subtraction to find words in the book that are not in the word list. Solution: http://thinkpython2.com/code/analyze_book2.py.
