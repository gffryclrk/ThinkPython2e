## Chapter 4
My understanding of the spirit of turtle graphics is to create shapes by moving the turtle defined distances in different directions. My understanding of the challenge is to change the direction relative to where the turtle is currently heading using turns of a certain angle either left or right. My goal for these exercises was to accomplish the goal without using absolute positioning: for example I avoided any goto (which seems to entirely defeat this idea) or setheading commands which can point the turtle north, south, east, west or anywhere in between. These types of absolutely positioning methods seem to defeat the spirit of the exercise. 

### Exercise 2: Flowers
This exercise took a bit of time. I wasn't sure how general I should make my solution but my goal was to be able to draw flowers of different sizes, with a variable number of petals and petal radius. This I believe I accomplished. The code needs to be tidied up but my flower and petal functions are currently in exercises.py.

### Exercise 3: Pies
This was a fun exercise. My solution perhaps isn't the most efficient but I'm not sure that was the goal of the exercise. Improving performance might depend on whether or not the pie in question has an Euler Path.

### Exercise 4: Letters
Constructing letters was fun but time consuming. I created A, B & C and decided that was probably enough for now. I'm sure that most of the rest of the capital letters can be constructed using a similar methodology.
