Write a function named point_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Point and returns True if the Point lies in or on the boundary of the circle.

Write a function named rect_in_circle that takes a Circle and a Rectangle and returns True if the Rectangle lies entirely in or on the boundary of the circle.
