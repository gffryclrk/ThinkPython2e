"""17.13 Exercises
    Exercise 17.7. This exercise is a cautionary tale about one of the most common, and difficult to
    find, errors in Python. Write a definition for a class named Kangaroo with the following methods:
    1. An __init__ method that initializes an attribute named pouch_contents to an empty list.
    2. A method named put_in_pouch that takes an object of any type and adds it to
    pouch_contents.
    3. A __str__ method that returns a string representation of the Kangaroo object and the con-
    tents of the pouch.
    Test your code by creating two Kangaroo objects, assigning them to variables named kanga and
    roo, and then adding roo to the contents of kangaâ€™s pouch.
